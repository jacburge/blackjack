Topic: troubleshooting; good bug-fix technique
*. A black-box QA tester has submitted a bug report against your
   Blackjack game.  It reads as follows:

   "Bug #2253: Cards dealt are not unique"
   Steps to reproduce:
   1 run 'python3 game.py'
   2 select a username, press enter twice
   3 hit or stay
   4 Both cards are identical
   - program should give two different cards

   As the developer on this code, fix the problem by performing the
   following steps in order (all steps are required).  Each number is a
   separate exercise:
   A. Write a test that demonstrates the bug *before* changing any code
   B. Fix the code so that the new test passes
   C. Check in the code with a commit message that references the bug
      number, a brief description of the bug, and what you did to fix it
   D. run pylint


Topic: Test cleanup
*. The test for the game.py file, test/test_game.py, contains a lot of
   redundant code.  Replace all the repeated code with a setUp()
   function at the top of the test class. Make sure you can run the tests, and
   they all pass, before changing anything.
   run pylint
