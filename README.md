Welcome to the exercise code for the Seattle Intermediate Python class!

This repository contains the code we will use in class to demonstrate
different concepts and ideas.  As it stands, it embodies a simple
Blackjack game, which is only about half-way done.  Your job will be,
through the exercises, to finish and improve the game.  Don't worry,
we'll show you what to do as we go!

For your own work, please modify the code in your own student
directory, which you'll find under the students directory.  If your
name doesn't exist yet, either create it yourself (copy the files under
the example/ directory), or Ian or Maria can create it for you.

If you haven't already, please join us on #intermediate_python in
Slack.

- Ian Johnston and Maria Mckinley
